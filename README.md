# wallpaper-maker

I usually find myself painting some kind of ornaments. I thought that it would be cool to make a script that would do something similar.

### Installation
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
> On windows
```
py main.py
```
> On mac/linux
```
python3 main.py
```
### Result so far
